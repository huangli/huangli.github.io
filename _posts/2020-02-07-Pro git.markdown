### 1. What is git

- To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.
- states
    + **Modified** means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet
    + **Staged** means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot
    + Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database

#### Global config 

- /etc/gitconfig
- ~/.gitconfig or ~/.config/git/config
- .git/config
- Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in .git/config trump those in /etc/gitconfig


#### Your Identity

``` 
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```


#### Help 

``` 
$ git help <verb>
$ git <verb> --help
$ man git-<verb>
$ git add -h
```

- you can ask for the more concise “help” output with the -h option, as in


### 2. Git Basics

> If you can read only one chapter to get going with Git, this is it

- You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:
    + You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or
    + You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.

```
- git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2

If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than libgit2
- git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit
```
